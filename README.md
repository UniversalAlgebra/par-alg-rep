## Notes on Representing a Finite Lattice as the Congruence Lattice of a Finite __Partial__ Algebra

This repository collects some notes about a few results---not all new---that we
establish during fall semester 2016, while the author was a postdoc at 
University of Hawaii, although the main result was discovered during a week-long
visit to Chapman University in October 2016.

This is joint work with **Peter Jipsen**.

**Title:** [Congruences of Partial and Total Algebras](https://github.com/UniversalAlgebra/par-alg-rep/raw/master/par-alg-rep.pdf)
**Author:** William DeMeo [@williamdemeo](https://github.com/williamdemeo)  
**Journal:** (unpublished note)
**Year:** October 2016  

**Abstract:** We give a straight-forward proof of the fact 
that every finite lattice is the congruence lattice of a 
finite partial algebra. Bill Lampe pointed out that this 
has been known for a long time, though our proof is new 
and seems simpler to us.

We also describe closure operators and review some useful 
facts about them. Finally, we recall a theorem from Berman's 
thesis that relates congruence lattices of partial algebras 
with those of total algebras.

The main purpose of this note is to describe some tools 
that we plan to exploit in our quest to represent every finite 
lattice as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra.
